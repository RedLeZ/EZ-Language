# Style Guide

## Code
- C++17
- Prefer clear names over abbreviations.
- Minimal inline comments; rely on self-explanatory code.
- Keep patches focused—avoid unrelated refactors.

## Grammar
- One production per line; group related.
- Keep skip tokens (WS/comments) at bottom.

## Docs
- Short headings, actionable examples.
- Every concept page: purpose, example, pitfalls, next link.
- Use lowercase hyphenated filenames.

## Commits (suggested)
Format:
```
feat(friend): add python shim generation
fix(interpreter): handle boolean literal tokens
```
